( 5 ) It appears desirable , for reasons of administrative simplification , to provide for specific procedures for releasing the guarantee . <SEP> In particular , it is necessary to specify the conditions for partial release and a minimum threshold below which the guarantee that should remain forfeited can be released .

( 2 ) The Helsinki European Council in December 1999 declared that Turkey is an acceding country which is to become a member of the Union on the basis of the same criteria as the other acceding countries . <SEP> Like the other candidate countries , Turkey is to benefit from a pre-accession strategy based on the existing European strategy , which will stimulate and support reforms .
